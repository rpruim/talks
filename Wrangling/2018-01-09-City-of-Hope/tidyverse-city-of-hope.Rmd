## Data used in the tutorial

For simplicity, all the data in this tutorial come from R packages.
We will rename some data sets so that in this tutorial data sets 
are capitalized and variables (mostly) are not.

```{r}
require(mosaic)        # loads part of tidyverse and some data sets
require(ggplot2movies) # contains a movies dataset
require(babynames)     # number of kids with each name for over 100 yrs
require(nycflights13)  # all flights in/out of NYC in 2013
require(weatherData)   # daily weather in a few cities

# rename so data sets are capitalized and variables (mostly) are not.
Movies    <- movies
Babynames <- babynames
Flights   <- flights
Planes    <- planes
Airports  <- airports
```

## What is the tidyverse?

### A collection of R packages 

 * written by Hadley Wickham (and friends)
 
 * that **play well together** 

 * to **create and manage**  
 
 * **tidy data**.

<div align="center">
### data I have \ $\stackrel{\mbox{tidyverse}}{\longrightarrow}$  \ data I want
</div>

## Tidy data

  * Rows are cases (of interest)
  
  * Columns are variables

### Tidy vs Clean

As grandma says: tidy and clean are two different things

  * tidy data may not be clean, but
  * tidy data are easier to clean,
  * and it is easier to tell whether data are clean when they are tidy 
 
### Glyph Ready Data

Many plotting libraries (including `ggformula` and `ggplot2`) require or work best with
"glyph ready" data:

  * information for each glyph (a mark on the "page") is in a single row.
  * attributes of each glyph are determined by values of variables in that row.

`tidyverse` tools are useful for creating glyph ready data.  

## Chaining with %>%

### The following are almost equivalent

```{r eval = FALSE}
f(x, y, ...)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(y, ...)
```

(When and where `x` is evaluated is not exactly the same and can matter.)

### Your Turn

Add a second line that is equivalent to the first but uses `%>%`.
(Note: Unless you use `set.seed()` you will get different results each time
because of different random choices.)

```{r, pipe01, exercise = TRUE}
sample_n(Movies, 3)     # 3 random movies
```

```{r, pipe01-solution}
sample_n(Movies, 3)     # 3 random movies
Movies %>% sample_n(3)  # 3 random movies; chaining syntax
```

## Little Bunny Foo Foo

Here's a silly example that illustrates why `%>%` is helpful.

    Little bunny Foo Foo
    Went hopping through the forest
    Scooping up the field mice
    And bopping them on the head.

### Without chaining

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bop(scoop(hop(foo_foo, through = forest), up = field_mice), on = head)
```

### With chaining

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

### Advantages of Chaining

  * reduces parenthesis chasing
  * keeps arguments near functions
  * mirrors order of operations (making code easier to read)
  * facilitates code editing (easy to eliminate or insert a step)

## Data Verbs

### Chaining in the tidyverse

Many functions in `tidyverse` 

  * take tidy data as a first argument
  
  * return tidy data as a result
  
  * do not have side effects
  
This sets them up for chaining:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_data <-
  old_data %>%
  do_this( ... ) %>%
  and_that( ... ) %>%
  and_the_other( ... )
```

We will refer to these kinds of functions as (transitive) **data verbs** 
because they do something to (tidy) data *without side effects*.

### Learning tidyverse Tools

There are basically two steps:

|                                                          |              |
|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------:|
| 1. Learn how each data verb works in isolation.          | (Low volume) |
| 2. Break down complex tasks into a sequence steps        | (Creativity) |


 
## Movies Data

The `Movies` data set contains information about movies.

```{r, inspect, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>% glimpse()
```

### Your Turn

 1. Change `glimpse()` to `inspect()` in the previous box; `inspect()` provides
an alternative way to take a quick look at a data set.

 2. Now change to `head()`.  What does this function do?
 
 3. Now change to `nrow()`.  What does this function do?
 
 4. Now change to `names()`.  What does this function do?
 
 5. Want more information?  Try `?movies`. (Note lower case here.)

### Quiz

```{r, quiz, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Is inspect() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  ),
  question("Is glimpse() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data."),
    answer("No, it has side effects.", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Is head() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data."),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  ),
  question("Is nrow() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  ),
  question("Is names() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  )
)
```

## 6 Main Data Verbs

We'll go through each of these in more detail in just a moment,
but here are the key data verbs.

### Reduction

1. `summarise()`: compute summary statistics

  * result is a 1-row data frame.  (This is a white lie, but useful for now.)

### Rows 

2. `filter()`:  **keep rows** that match logical condition (discard the others)
3. `arrange()`: reorder the rows (i.e., sort)

### Columns

4. `select()`: **keep** some **variables** (columns) (discard the others)
5. `mutate()`: create **new variables** and add them to the data

### Grouping

6. `group_by()`: data unchanged, but groups are noted.

    - `ungroup()`:  clear grouping notes

### But wait, there's more!  

Here are some other data verbs


- `transmute()` like `mutate()`, but returns only the new variables
- `rename()`: rename some of the variables
- `distinct()`: returns each unique row once
- `sample_n()`: returns randomly selected row(s)
- `sample_frac()`: returns randomly selected row(s)
- `head()`:  returns the first few rows
- `tail()`: returns the last few rows

## One-row summaries with summarise()

Note: `summarize()` works for non New Zelanders, 
but it conflicts with a funciton with that same name in another package.

```{r, summarise, exercise = TRUE}
# number of movies (cases) in movie data
Movies %>% summarise(n())
```

`n()` only works in special `tidyverse` functions (like `summarise()`) and computes the 
same value as `nrow()` but doesn't require us to name the data set inside `summarise()`.
(This will be more important shortly.)

```{r, summarise-nrow, exercise = TRUE}
# same information but different data format
Movies %>% 
  summarise( n = nrow(Movies))
```

### Multi-tasking allowed

```{r, summarise02, exercise = TRUE}
# mean and total number of minutes of all the movies
Movies %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_length  = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_length =  sum(length, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

### Your turn

Add one more variable to the example above: the total length of all the movies *in years*.

```{r, summarise03, exercise = TRUE}
# mean and total number of minutes of all the movies
Movies %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_length  = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_length =  sum(length, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

```{r, summarise03-solution}
# mean and total number of minutes of all the movies
Movies %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_length  = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_length =  sum(length, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_length_years =  sum(length, na.rm = TRUE) / (60 * 24 * 365),
    total_length_years2 =  total_length / (60 * 24 * 365)
    )
```

### Useful functions for use with summarise()

- `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, `sd()`, `median()`, `IQR()`, ...
- `n()`: number of observations in the current group
- `n_distinct()`: number of unique values of a variable
- `first_value()`, `last_value()`, `nth_value(x, n)`


## select()

Let's make a data set that has **fewer variables**.

```{r, slim-movies}
Slim_Movies <- 
  Movies %>% 
  select(title, budget, length, mpaa)

Slim_Movies %>% sample_n(4)
```

- Reminder: `select()` is for *columns*
- Can use `:` to specify ranges of variables: `title : budget`
- Can use `-` to deselect variables: `-length`


### Your Turn

Select some variables of your own choosing.

```{r, movies-names}
Movies %>% names()
```

```{r, slim-movies02, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>% 
  select( ??? )
```


## Creating subsets -- filter() and friends

Often it is useful to work with a subset of the data 

 * inspect a few rows to understand the data
 * small data sets for prototyping analysis methods
 * analyses applied only to an "interesting" subset of the data
 * training and test data sets

### Beginning and End

```{r, head-tail, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% head(3)       # first few rows
Slim_Movies %>% tail(3)       # last few rows
```

### Random sample

```{r, random, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% sample_n(3)          # 3 random rows
Slim_Movies %>% sample_frac(.00007)  # random fraction of rows
```

### filter()

Let's use only use movies (cases) that have budget information and 
have shorter titles.

```{r, filter-budget, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 <- 
  Movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(budget), nchar(title) <= 24)

Movies2 %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), longest_title = max(nchar(title)))
```

## Creating new variables -- mutate() and friends

`mutate()` can be used to add new variables (columns) that are calculated 
from existing variables.
For example, let's compute the dollars per minute (of runtime) for our films.

```{r, mutate, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(budget)) %>%
  mutate(dpm = round(budget / length, 2)) %>%   # $ per minute
  head(6)
```

#### Your Turn

Change `mutate()` to `transmute()`.  How do they differ?




## group_by()

`group_by()` is what makes this system really hum.  When tidy data is marked
with groups, some subsequent data verbs are applied **within groups**.


```{r, group-by, exercise = TRUE}
# mean length of movies in hours for all the movies, broken down by mpaa
Movies2 %>% 
  mutate(
    hours = length / 60,
    dpm = budget / length) %>% 
  group_by(mpaa) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mean_length = mean(hours, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Your Turn

 1. Add some additional summaries of your choosing.
 2. Group by length of title instead of by rating.

### Important Note

Groups are in some sense "invisible", and it is easy to forget about them.
When saving data that have been created with a grouping, you may want to 
use `ungroup()` to remove the grouping information and let future you
start fresh -- just saying...

### group() and mutate()

`group()` impacts (some) other operations as well.  What happens when 
`mutate()` is applied after `group_by()`?

```{r, group-mutate, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>%
  group_by(mpaa) %>%
  mutate(length_rank = rank(-length)) %>%
  filter(length_rank < 3) %>%
  select(title, length, length_rank)
```

### Important Note

Groups are in some sense "invisible", and it is easy to forget about them.
When saving data that have been created with a grouping, you may want to 
use `ungroup()` to remove the grouping information and let future you
start fresh -- just saying...


## arrange() reorders the cases

#### Your Turn


```{r, arange-issues, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>%
  group_by(mpaa) %>%
  mutate(length_rank = rank(-length)) %>%
  filter(length_rank <= 3) %>%
  select(title, length, length_rank)  %>%
  arrange(mpaa, length_rank)
```

#### Note about groups

By default, `arrange()` ignores groups.  If you use `.by_group = TRUE`,
then sorting will be done by grouping variables first, then by additional
variables specified.

### Group, summarise, arrange

Group-summarise-arrange is a common operation to list groups in
an order based on some calculation.  

#### Your Turn

Fill in the missing pieces here to list the ratings in order
of average length of film.  Feel free to include additional
summary quantities as well if you like.

```{r, arrange, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>% 
  group_by( ?? )  %>% 
  summarise( ?? ) %>%
  arrange( ?? )
```


## What else is there?

### Lots more.  Here are few examples.

 * `spread()` and `gather()` for converting from "long" to "wide or 
 from "wide" to "long" shapes
 
 * `separate()` splitting a single variable into multiple variables.

 * `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` to (intelligently) glue data frames top-to-bottom or left-to-right.
 
 * `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, etc. for merging data 
 from multiple sources.  (Like joins in SQL.)
 
 * `lubridate` has functions for working with dates and times
 
[TB Case Study tutorial](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu/tidy-tb) illustrates
some of these in a case study using data from the World Health Organization.

### bind_rows()

The easiest way to combine data from multiple sources is when each source represents
"more of the same thing".  Each data set might represent one site, one date (range),
one researcher, etc.

`bind_rows()` will stack data sets, using column names to align and filling in with `NA` if 
some columns are missing in some data sets.

#### Example: Weather data from multiple cities

```{r weather01, exercise = TRUE}
NewYork2013 %>% head(3)
Mumbai2013 %>% head(3)
London2013 %>% head(3)
SFO2013 %>% head(3)
```

The following code combines the data from the four cities, but since the data 
sets didn't include the city as a column, we can't tell which data comes from which city.
Modify the code below to add a city column to each of the individual data sets.

```{r, weather02, exercise = TRUE}
MyWeather <- 
  bind_rows(
    NewYork2013, 
    Mumbai2013, 
    London2013, 
    SFO2013
  )
MyWeather %>% sample_n(5)
```

```{r, weather02-solution}
MyWeather <-
  bind_rows(
    NewYork2013 %>% mutate(city = "New York"), 
    Mumbai2013 %>% mutate(city = "Mumbai"), 
    London2013 %>% mutate(city = "London"), 
    SFO2013    %>% mutate(city = "San Francisco")
  )
MyWeather %>% sample_n(5)
```

#### Your Turn -- Bonus

Use the combined weather data to create a plot like this showing daily 
high and low temperatures in each city.

```{r, weather03, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}
bind_rows(
    NewYork2013 %>% mutate(city = "New York"), 
    Mumbai2013 %>% mutate(city = "Mumbai"), 
    London2013 %>% mutate(city = "London"), 
    SFO2013 %>% mutate(city = "San Francisco")
  ) %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::date(Time)) %>%
  group_by (city, date) %>%
  summarise(
    lo = min(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    hi = max(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
  )  %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., color = ~mean) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_gradientn(colors = rev(rainbow(10))))
```

**Notes** 

 1. Dates
 
    * `lubridate::date()` will convert the times into dates.  You can use `mutate()`
    to add a `date` variable to the data.
 
 2. Colors
 
    * First do this using the default colors. 
    * In `ggformula` or `ggplot2`, the color scale can be modified using 
 `scale_color_gradientn()`.  A vector of ten rainbow colors can be produced 
 using `rainbow(10)`.  (You will likely want to use `rev(rainbow(10))` to get
 the warm colors with the higher temperatures.)
    * Feel free to use other custom color choices if you like.

```{r, weather04, fig.height = 4, exercise = TRUE}
MyWeather <- 
  bind_rows(
    NewYork2013, 
    Mumbai2013, 
    London2013, 
    SFO2013
  )
```

```{r, weather04-solution, fig.height = 4, echo = FALSE}
bind_rows(
    NewYork2013 %>% mutate(city = "New York"), 
    Mumbai2013 %>% mutate(city = "Mumbai"), 
    London2013 %>% mutate(city = "London"), 
    SFO2013 %>% mutate(city = "San Francisco")
  ) %>%
  mutate(date = lubridate::date(Time)) %>%
  group_by (city, date) %>%
  summarise(
    lo = min(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    hi = max(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
  )  %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  gf_linerange(lo + hi ~ date | city ~ ., color = ~mean) %>%
  gf_refine(scale_color_gradientn(colors = rev(rainbow(10))))
```
### Database connections

These same commands can be used to [manage data in an SQL data base](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/).
 
* converts data verbs into SQL query
* allows you to inspect the query
* only fetches a few rows unless you ask for more (to save time while
  you are debugging)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# establish connection -- details vary by type of database
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 
  host = "database.rstudio.com",
  user = "hadley",
  password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
)

# extract a table
flights_db <- tbl(con, "flights")

# treat it just like in-memory data (mostly)
flights_db %>%
  group_by(...) %>%
  mutate(...) %>%
  summarise(...) %>%
  collect()          # get me all of the data
```

**Notes** 

 * Some R commands can't be translated into SQL and so don't work inside `mutate()`, `summarise()`, etc. 
 
 * Recent R Studio releases include expanded support for working with databases.
 

## Your Turn -- More Movies

### A Smaller Data Set

When starting, it can be helpful to work with a small subset of the data.  When
you have your data wrangling statements in working order, shift to the entire
data table.

```{r, small-subset, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies <-
  Movies %>%
  filter(year > 2000) %>%
  filter(mpaa != "") 
```

You can use the smaller data set as you are figuring out the solutions to these
exercises.  Once have it sussed, you can switch to the full `Movies` data.

### Your Turn

#### What is the average IMDB user rating?

```{r, rating, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  summarise(avg = ????(rating)) 
```


#### What is the average IMDB user rating of movies for each mpaa category?

```{r, rating-by-cat, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>% 
  group_by(????) %>% 
  summarise(avg = ????(rating))
```

#### How many Action Movies in each year?

```{r, action-movies, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  group_by(????) %>%
  summarise(Actioncount = sum(????))
```

#### How many Comedies of each mpaa rating in each year?

```{r, comedies, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  group_by(????, ????) %>%
  summarise(????)
```


#### Track the average IMDB ratings for movies with mpaa "R" over the years.

```{r r-movies, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>%
  filter(mpaa == "R") %>%     # just the rated R movies
  group_by(year) %>%          # for each year for each movie title
  summarise(mean_user_rating = ????) %>%
  gf_point(mean_user_rating ~ year)  # plot results
```


#### Track the number of IMDB ratings given to R movies over the years

You could use total number or average number.  Your choice.

(Hint: Use `votes` to see how many votes were cast for each movie.)

```{r r-movies-2, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>%
  filter(mpaa == "R") %>%     # just the rated R movies
  group_by(year) %>%          # for each year for each movie title
  summarise(????) %>%
  gf_line(??? ~ year)  # plot results
```

#### Challenge

Calculate the average per rating rather than the average per movie.
