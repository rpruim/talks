> You’ve got to watch that you **don’t do too much**. We have a philosophy on our coaching staff about **less volume, more creativity**. 


### The Minimal R Exercise

**List** every R command used throughout a course/project

**Organize** by syntactic similarity and by purpose

**Scratch** everything you could have done without

**Replace** dissimilar tools with more similar tools

**Aim** for a set of commands that is

 * **small**: fewer is better
 * **coherent**:  commands should be as similar as possible
 * **powerful**: can do what needs doing 

**Result:** Minimal R for Intro Stats

[[ggformula]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mosaic/vignettes/MinimalRgg.pdf)

### Less Volume, More Creativity 
 
It is not enough to use R, 
it must be used efficiently and elegantly because 
**human brain power is the most limited resource** 
most of our projects have.

### Choose Wisely

R's biggest strength is also its biggest weakness:  A large, active user base that 
provides packages for the community to use.

 * quality varies from package to package, so does style
 * new things keep coming (so you need to revisit your choices)
 
If you are new to R, you will learn faster and be happier if you can learn **a
few flexible tools** very well than if you run with the first thing you google
that gets today's job done.

If you are teaching, your students will become more proficient mo*re quickly (and
with less stress) if you follow a **Less Volume, More Creativity** approach.

### Some propopsed solutions

 * `mosaic` and `ggformula` (previously `lattice`) -- making the most of formulas
 
 * `tidyverse` -- grammar of data transformation (but `ggplot2` doesn't really fit)
 
 * R Markdown -- document creation for humans who use R

### Why ggformula?

1. Starting point: **modeling with formulas** 

  * `lm()`, `t.test()`, etc.
    
2. **Plotting with formulas**

  * `lattice` 
  
    * **low volume**: also uses the formula interface, but
    
    * **low creativity**:  the plots are not modular, harder to be creative (and many
      find that the plots don't look as nice)
    
  * `ggplot2` 
  
    * **high creativity**: fixes the problems with `lattice`
    
    * **high volume**: but the code looks completely different
  
  * `ggformula` provides a formula interface to `ggplot2` graphics
  
    * **Less Volume** and **More Creativity**
    
    * input will look like `lattice` and modeling functions
    
    * output will look like `ggplot2`
    
    * layering will look like `tidyverse` (`%>%`)
    
3. `mosaic` allows for numerical summaries with the same code template.  (More later.)

```{r, numerical-summaries, exercise = TRUE, include = FALSE}
    mean(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)        # results as vector
df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, mean)  # results as data frame
df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, mean, sd)   # 2 at once    
df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)        
```

## US Births in 1978

Here is an interesting plot showing the number of live births in the United
States each day of 1978.  

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

 1. What patterns do you notice in this data?
 
 2. What possible explanations could there be for these patterns?
 
 3. What explanations might students give that indicate they are misunderstanding the plot?

## How do we make this plot?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

We are going to use this plot

  * to learn how to create plots using the `ggformula` package 
  
  * to begin thinking about designing, describing, and interpreting plots more generally

## Two important questions

To get R (or any software) to create this plot (or do anything else, really),
there are two important questions you must be able to answer. 
<!-- Before continuing, see if you can figure out **what two questions we have in mind**. -->

### The Questions

#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?
  
#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?

### Answers

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

To make this plot, the answers to our questions are 

#### 1. What do you want the computer to do?

 * Make a scatter plot 
 
    * better answer: a **plot** consisting of **points**
  
#### 2. What must the computer know in order to do that?

 * The data used for the plot:

    * The variable to be plotted along the y-axis.
    * The variable to be plotted along the x-axis.
    * The data set that contains the variables.
      
#### We just need to learn how to tell R these answers.     


## Plotting with Formulas

### The Formula Template

We will provide answers to our two questions by filling in
the boxes of this important template:

<center>
<h3><strong><span class="invboxed">goal</span> ( <span class="invboxed">yyy</span> ~ <span class="invboxed">xxx</span> , data = <span class="invboxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h3></center>

&nbsp;

We just need to identify which portions of our answers go into which boxes.

### The Name of the Game

It is useful to provide names for the boxes:

<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h3></center>
&nbsp;

These names can help us remember which things go where.
(The `...` indicates that there are some additional arguments we will add
eventually.)

<!-- #### Other versions -->

<!-- Sometimes we will add or subtract a bit from our formula. -->
<!-- Here are some other forms we will eventually see. -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE, echo = TRUE} -->
<!-- # simpler version -->
<!-- goal( ~ x, data = mydata )           -->
<!-- # fancier version -->
<!-- goal( y ~ x | z , data = mydata )    -->
<!-- # unified version -->
<!-- goal( formula , data = mydata )      -->
<!-- ``` -->

### 2 Questions and the Formula Template


&nbsp;
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ... )</strong> 
</h3></center>
 
&nbsp;


#### Q. What do you want R to do?

* This determines the function to use -- the **goal**.

    * For a plot, the function will describe what sorts of marks to draw (points, in our example).
 
    * other possibilities include lines, boxplots, etc, etc.
    
    * all the plot functions in `ggformula` begin `gf_`.

#### Q. What must R know to do that? 

* This determines the inputs to the function.
 
    * For a plot, we must identify the variables and the data frame that contains them.
 
### Assembling the pieces

#### Template

&nbsp;
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h3></center>
 
&nbsp;

#### Pieces

<table align = "center" >
<tr>
  <th> box </th>
  <th> fill in with </th>
  <th> purpose </th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `goal` </td>
  <td> `gf_point` </td>
  <td> plot some points </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `y` </td>
  <td> `births` </td>
  <td> y-axis variable</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `x` </td>
  <td> `date` </td>
  <td> x-axis variable </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td> `mydata` </td>
  <td> `Births1978`</td>
  <td> name of data set </td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Exercise

Put each piece in its place in the template below and then run the code
to create the plot. 

```{r, gf_point, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
goal(y ~ x, data = mydata)
```

<div id="gf_point-hint">
If you get an "object not found" or "could not find function" error message,
that indicates that you have not correctly filled in one of the four boxes from
the template.  

Note: R is case sensitive, so watch your capitalization.
</div>
  
For the record, here are the first few rows of `Births1978`.
  
```{r}
Births1978 %>% head(3) %>% select(births, date, day_of_year, wday)
```

### Formulas in R

The most distinctive feature of `ggformula` plots is the use of formulas to 
describe the positional information of a plot.
Formulas in R always involve the tilde character, which is easy to overlook.
It looks like this:  

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("../images/tilde.png")
```

The position of ![](../images/tilde-small.png) on the keyboard varies from brand to brand. On Apple keyboards, it's here.

```{r tilde02, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/keyboard-tilde.png")

```
<!-- #### Exercise -->

<!-- Find the ![](../images/tilde-small.png) on your keyboard and type `births ~ date` in  -->
<!-- the code block.  That's the formula we need for our plot. -->

<!-- ```{r type-tilde, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 2} -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r type-tilde-check, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- set_success_message("Good. That's all this exercise was about: typing a formula.") -->
<!-- t1 <- find_call("whatever ~ whatever", message = "do you have a tilde (~)?  Does your formula have two sides?") -->
<!-- t2 <- find_call("births ~ date", message = "you need to have the y-axis variable on the left and the x-axis variable on the right") -->

<!-- USER_CODE %>% t1 %>% t2  -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Using formulas to describe plots

Most `gf_` functions take a formula that describes the positional
attributes of the plot.  Using one of these functions with no arguments
will show you the "shape" of the formula it requires.

#### Exercise

Run this code to see the formula shape for `gf_point()`.

```{r, gf-shape, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point()
```

You should see that `gf_point()`'s formula has the shape `y ~ x`, 
so the y-variable name goes before the tilde and the x-variable name goes
after.  (Think:  "y depends on x".  Also note that the y-axis label appears
farther left than the x-axis label.)


#### Exercise

Change `date` to `day_of_year` and see how the plot changes.
(If you do this on a separate line, you will see both plots at once.)

```{r, gf_point-day_of_year, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```

#### Bonus Exercise (Optional)

Reverse the roles of the variables -- changing `births ~ date` to 
`date ~ birth` -- to see how the plot changes.


## Changing things up: different types of plots

Our plots have points because we have used `gf_point()`.  But there are 
many other `gf_` functions that create different types of plots.
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="invboxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;births&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;date&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">Births1978</span> )</strong> 
</h3></center>
&nbsp;

#### Exercise

Experiment with some other plot types by changing `gf_point()` to 
one of the following:

  * `gf_line()`: connect the dots
  * `gf_lm()`: a regression line (lm = linear model)
  * `gf_smooth()`: smoothed version of `gf_line()` (LOESS or lm)
  * `gf_spline()`: another type of smoother (using splines)

Which type of plot reveals **exceptional cases** the best?  What are those exceptional
cases?

```{r, gf_point-layer, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978)
```


## Plots with one positional variable

Some `gf_` functions only require the user to supply one variable. The y-positions
for these plots can calculated from the x-variable.

Here are two examples.  Run the code below to see the formula shapes used by
these plots.

```{r, one-var-plot-help, exercise = TRUE}
gf_histogram()
gf_density()
```

Notice that when there is only one variable it is always on the **right** side.

&nbsp;
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> )</strong> 
</h3></center>
 
&nbsp;


Other examples of functions that take just one variable include 

 * `gf_dhistogram()` -- density histogram (the right way to do a histogram)
 * `gf_dens()` 
 * `gf_freqpoly()` 
 * `gf_dotplot()` 
 * `gf_ash()`
 * `gf_bar()` 
 * `gf_cols()` 
 * `gf_qq()`

#### Exercise

Create some "one-variable" plots using the functions listed above 
and the template below.  Which variable should you use?


```{r, births-names, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
names(Births1978)
```

```{r, gf_histogram-etc, echo = TRUE, exercise = TRUE}
gf____( ~ _____, data = Births1978)
```


## Changing things up: options

If you created the spline plot, you probably found it "too wiggly".  If you created 
the smoothed plot, you might prefer that the gray bands not be displayed.  For any
of these plots you might have preferred different colors or sizes of things.
Such global characteristics of a plot can be adjusted with additional arguments to
the `gf_` function. These go in the `...` part of the template.

&nbsp;
<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h3></center>
&nbsp;

The general form for these is `option = value`.

For example, 

  * `spar = 0.5` (or any number between 0 and 1) controls the amount of smoothing in `gf_spline()`.
  * `se = FALSE` (note capitalization) turns off the "error band" in `gf_smooth()`.
  * `color = "red"` or `fill = "navy"` (note quotes) can be used to change the colors of things.  (`fill` is typically used for regions that are "filled in" and `color` for dots and lines.)
  * `alpha = 0.5` (or any number between 0 and 1) will set the opacity (0 is completely
  transparent and 1 is completely opaque).


#### Exercises

Here are some examples.  Adjust some of the options to see how things change.
We've inserted some line breaks to make the options easier to locate in the code.

```{r, gf-options-1, exercise = TRUE}
gf_spline(births ~ date, data = Births1978, 
          spar = 0.5, 
          color = "navy")
```


```{r, gf-options-2, exercise = TRUE}
gf_smooth(births ~ date, data = Births1978, 
          se = FALSE, 
          color = "red")
```

```{r, gf-options-3, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, 
         size = 3, shape = 18,
         alpha = 0.5, color = "purple")
```

 
#### What attributes are available?

You can learn about the attributes available for a given layer using the 
"quick help" for a layer function.  You can find out more by reading the help file
produced with `?`.

```{r, quick-help, exercise = TRUE}
# "quick help" for gf_point()
gf_point()
```

#### What are the color names?  
  
Curious to know all the available color names? Run this code.

```{r, colors, exercise = TRUE}
colors()
```


## Multiple layers with %>%

We said that `gf_point()` creates a plot with points. 
This isn't quite true. Technically, it creates a **layer** with points.
A plot may have multiple layers.  To create a multi-layered plot, simply
append `%>%` at the end of the code for one layer and follow that with
another layer.

#### Exercise

 1. If you run the following code as is, you will get three separate plots.
 2. Combine these three layers into a single plot by appending `%>%` at
the end of the first two lines.
 3. That's pretty ugly.  Now change the x-axis variable to `day_of_year` so 
 that all three years are aligned.
 4. If you like, change the plot type to `gf_smooth()` or `gf_spline()`.

```{r multi-layers, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = "navy") 
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1969, color = "red")
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1988, color = "skyblue")
```

## Mapping attributes

The births data in 1978 contains two clear "waves" of dots.  One conjecture
is that these are weekdays and weekends.  We can test this conjecture
by putting different days in different colors.

In the lingo of `ggformula`, we need to **map** color to the variable `wday`.
**Mapping** and **setting** attributes are different in an important way.

 * `color = "navy"` **sets** the color to "navy".  All the dots will be navy.
 
 *  `color = ~ wday` **maps** color to `wday`. This means that the color will 
 depend on the values of `wday`. A legend (aka, a guide) will be 
 automatically included to show us which days are which.
 
#### Exercise

  1. Change the color argument so that it maps to `wday`.
  Don't forget the tilde (`~`).
  
  2. Try some other plot types: `gf_line()`, `gf_smooth()`, etc.  Which do you
  like best? Why?
  
  
```{r, color-mapping, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(births ~ date, data = Births1978, color = "navy")
```

```{r color-mapping-quiz, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question(
    "Does it appear that the conjecture about weekends is generally correct?",
    answer("yes", correct = TRUE),
    answer("no")
  ),
  question(
    "What happens if you omit the `~` before `~wday`?",
    answer("It works just the same.  The tilde isn't required."),
    answer("All the dots are the same color."),
    answer("There is an error message: 'wday' not found.", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```

## Facets

### Facets are coordinated subplots

If we want to look at all 20 years of birth data, overlaying the data
is likely to put too much information in too little space and make it hard to tell which
data is from which year.  (Deciphering 20 colors or 20 shapes can be hard, too.)
Instead, let's put each year in separate **facet** or sub-plot.  Facets are better
than 20 separate plots because the coordinate systems are shared across the facets
which saves space and makes comparisons across facets easier.

There are two ways to create facets.  The simplest way is to add a vertical bar `|` to
our formula.


```{r, births-facets, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year, data = Births, size = 0.5)
```

The second way is to add on a facet command using `%>%`:

```{r, births-facets-wrap, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year, data = Births, size = 0.5) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap( ~ year)
```

#### Exercise

Edit one of the plots above to do the following:

  1. map color to `wday`
  2. change from points to lines or one of the smoothers
  
```{r, births-facets-ex1, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 6}
```

#### Exercise

Now edit one of the plots above to

  1. remove the facets, and 
  2. use `date` instead of `day_of_year`
  
What advantage do we get from using facets in this case?

```{r, births-facets-ex2, exercise = TRUE}
```

### Facet Grids and Facet Wraps

The faceting we did on the previous page is called facet wrapping.  If the facets
don't fit nicely in one row, the facets continue onto additional rows.

A facet grid uses rows, or columns, or both in a fixed way.

```{r, facet-grid, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}
gf_point(births ~ day_of_year | year ~ wday, data = Births, size = 0.5)
```

#### Exercise

Recreate the plot above using `gf_facet_grid()`.  This works much like `gf_facet_wrap()`
and accepts a formula with one of three shapes

  * `y ~ x` (facets along both axes)
  * ` ~ x`  (facets only along x-axis)
  * `y ~ .` (facets only along y-axis; notice the important dot in this one)  

(These three formula shapes can also be used on the right side of `|`.)

  
```{r, facet-grid2, exercise = TRUE, fig.height = 9}
```

## More Practice 

Time to explore on your own.  Here are some data sets you can use.

  * `Births1969` through `Births1988` contain birth data for individual years.
  * `HELPrct` has data from a study of people addicted to alcohol, cocaine, or heroine
  * `KidsFeet` has information about some kids' feet.
  * `NHANES` has lots of physiologic and other measurements from 10,000
  subjects in the National Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey.
  
To find out more about the data sets use `?HELPrct`, `?KidsFeet`, or  `?NHANES`.
To see the first few rows of the `KidsFeet` data, you can use `head(KidsFeet)`.

To get a list of functions available in `ggformula`, run this code chunk.

```{r, apropos, exercise = TRUE}
# list all functions starting gf_
apropos("gf_")
```

#### Exercise.

Make some plots to explore one or more of these data sets.

 * Experiment with different types of plots.
 * Use mapping and/or facets to reveal groups.
 * You can put more than one plot in a code chunk, but we've provided two chunks
 in case you want to separate your work that way.  Use one chunk for experimenting
 and copy and paste your favorites to the other chunk if you like.

```{r, explore, exercise = TRUE}
head(KidsFeet)
gf_bar( ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
gf_violin(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet) %>%
  gf_jitter(length ~ sex, height = 0, width = 0.15)
?KidsFeet
```

```{r, explore-more, exercise = TRUE}

```

## Where do we go from here?

### Bells & Whistles

If you are fussy about your plots, you may be wondering how to have more control over 
things like:

 * custom labeling, including titles and axis labels
 * fonts, colors, and sizes of text
 * color of plot elements like background, grid lines, facet labels, etc.
 * custom scales (user chosen colors, sizes, etc.)
 * etc, etc.
  
As you can imagine, all of these things can be adjusted pretty much however you like.
But we'll save that for a separate tutorial on customizing your plots.

### Bells & Whistles with students
 
My approach: 

 * Let the students ask or 
 * Let the data analysis drive 

### Bells & Whistles -- an ugly example

This is ugly, but hints at some of the things that can be modified
with bells and whistles.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
gf_line(births ~ date,  color = ~ wday, data = Births78, size = 1.2) %>%
  gf_point(births ~ date,  color = ~ wday, data = Births78, size = 2) %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_color_manual(
      values = c("orange", "pink", "brown", "navy", "green", "red", "gray50")),
    guides(color = guide_legend("day of week")),
    theme(text = element_text(color = "green", size = 15, face = "italic"))
    ) %>%
  gf_labs(title = "Births in the US (1978)", 
          x = "date in 1978", 
          y = "Numbr of live births")
```  

### A Challenge Plot

Here is a more intersting example that takes advantage of bells and whistles. 

```{r, challenge, exercise = TRUE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6}
head(trial2$neg, 2)
colorsB <- brewer.pal(5, "Spectral")[c(2,3,4,5,1)]
gf_col(Freq ~ citystate, fill = ~ Response2, data = trial2$neg) %>%
  gf_col(data = trial2$pos, fill = ~ Response2) %>%
  gf_facet_wrap( ~ year, nrow = 3) %>%
  gf_refine(
    scale_fill_manual(
      breaks = c("Not at all satisfied", "2", "3","4", "Extremely satisfied"),
      values = colorsB,
      name = "Response"),
    scale_y_continuous(
      limits=c(-0.5, 1),
      breaks=seq(from=-0.5, to=0.75, by=0.25),
      labels=c("50%", "25%", "0", "25%", "50%", "75%")
    ),
    coord_flip()
  ) %>%
  gf_labs(
    title = "Community satisfaction", x = "", y = "") %>%
  gf_theme(
    legend.text=element_text(size=10),
    legend.title=element_text(size=12),
    axis.text=element_text(size=4, angle = 30),
    strip.text=element_text(size=11))
```

### Learning More

The `ggformula` package includes some vignettes and two tutorials.

```
> library(ggformula)
Loading required package: ggplot2

New to ggformula?  Try the tutorials: 
	learnr::run_tutorial("introduction", package = "ggformula")
	learnr::run_tutorial("refining", package = "ggformula")
```

Many ProjectMOSAIC resources are being rewritten to use `ggformula`.

## Numerical Summaries

One of the powerful features of the formula template is that it can be used for other 
things in addition to plotting.  
For example, numerical summaries can be created using
the same formula template.

### Augmented statistical summary functions.

R includes a number of statistical summary functions, but out of the box, they don't know about formulas.
The `mosaic` package augments these to make them "formula-aware".  This works for functions like
`mean()`, `median()`, `sd()`, `iqr()`, `max()`, `min()`, etc.

**Big idea:** Replace plot name with summary name

 * Nothing else changes

```{r, mean-et-al, exercise = TRUE}
gf_boxplot(births ~ wday, data = Births1978)
      mean(births ~ wday, data = Births1978)
```

#### Exercise

Change `mean()` to one of the other summary functions in the example above.

### df_stats -- a general tool

`df_stats()` returns a data frame instead of a plot and can be used to create a wide variety of numerical 
summaries using the same formula structure that we use for plotting.

```{r, numerical, exercise = TRUE}
df_stats(births ~ wday, data = Births1978, mean)
```

#### Exercise

 1. Change mean to one or more of the following: `median`, `sd`, `max`, `min`.

 2. What happens if you omit `mean` and don't replace it with anything?


## Modeling with formulas

This is really the starting point for this Less Volume, More Creativity approach.  Since R uses formulas for modeling,
it reduces cognitive load to use formulas for graphical and numerical summaries as well.  There are lots of resources
about fitting various sorts of models in R.  Here we will just illustrate how similar numerical summaries, graphical
summaries and models look syntactically.

### A two sample t-test

Notice how similar these command are, then run them.

```{r, t-test, exercise = TRUE}
      mean(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
  df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
gf_boxplot(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
    t.test(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
```

### Linear models

```{r, lm, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet) %>%
   gf_lm(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
     cor(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
      lm(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
```

### Linear model with a covariate

```{r, broom, exercise = TRUE}
gf_point(length ~ width, color = ~ sex, data = KidsFeet) %>%
   gf_lm(length ~ width, color = ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
      lm(length ~ width * sex, data = KidsFeet)
```

#### Exercise

Delete all of the arguments to `gf_lm()` in the example above.  Notice that things still work!  `gf_lm()` inherits the 
formula, data and color from the earlier layer.


Other packages you may be interested in for working with models: `broom`, `mosaicModel`.

## One template to rule a lot

Our one template gets us a lot: graphical summaries, numerical summaries, and modeling.

<center>
<h3><strong><span class="boxed">goal</span> ( <span class="boxed">&nbsp;y&nbsp;</span> ~ <span class="boxed">&nbsp;x&nbsp;</span> , data = <span class="boxed">mydata</span> , ...)</strong> 
</h3></center>
&nbsp;

Here is just a sample of things we can do with this template.

```{r, one-var, exercise = TRUE}
gf_histogram( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
 gf_freqpoly( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
     gf_dens( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
  gf_density( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
      gf_ash( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
        mean( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
          sd( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
    df_stats( ~ age, data = HELPrct)
    df_stats( ~ age, data = HELPrct, mean, sd)
      t.test( ~ age, data = HELPrct)  
      t.test( ~ age, data = HELPrct) %>% confint()
      t.test( ~ age, data = HELPrct) %>% pval()  # silly
        
      gf_bar( ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
       tally( ~ substance, data = HELPrct)
    df_stats( ~ substance, data = HELPrct, counts)
    df_stats( ~ substance, data = HELPrct, props)
```

```{r, two-var, exercise = TRUE}
  gf_point(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet) %>%
     gf_lm(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet, color = "red") %>%
 gf_smooth(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet, se = FALSE) 
        lm(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
       cor(length ~ width, data = KidsFeet)
        
gf_boxplot(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
 gf_violin(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, fill = "skyblue", alpha = 0.3) %>%
 gf_jitter(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, width = 0.2, height = 0)
      mean(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
  df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
  df_stats(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet, mean, sd)
    t.test(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
        lm(length ~ sex, data = KidsFeet)
```

## But Wait, There's More!

The `mosaic` and `ggformula` packages include a few other things that you might like to use for your classes.

### Interactive Plotting

In RStudio, `mplot(Births1978)` will launch an interactive tool for designing plots
using `ggformula`, `ggplot2`, or `lattice`.  Pushing a button will reveal the
code to create the plot.  This is a handy way to experiment, to migrate from one
system to another, or to get a reminder about how to do a particular task.

```{r, out.width = "90%", fig.align = "center", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/mplot-screenshot.png")
```

### Plotting distributions 

`gf_dist()` is a bit different since it doesn't use a formula.  In fact, it doesn't use data at all.  It just plots the 
density function for a specified distribution.

```{r, gf-dist, exercise = TRUE}
gf_dist("chisq", df = 3)
```

### Probabilities from distributions (with plots)

```{r, xpnorm, exercise = TRUE}
xpnorm(600, mean = 500, sd = 100)
xqt(.90, df = 12)
xqchisq(c(0.8, 0.9, 0.95), df = 4)
```

### Plotting fitted distributions

It is also possible to fit distributions to data and display the best fitting member of a family of distributions.  (Fitting is done via maximum likelihood and limited to a dozen or so of the most commonly used distributions.)

```{r, gf-fitdistr, exercise = TRUE}
gf_dhistogram( ~ age | substance, data = HELPrct, alpha = 0.6) %>%
  gf_fitdistr() %>%   # normal fit by default
  gf_fitdistr(dist = "dgamma", color = "red")  # fit gamma distributions instead.
```
