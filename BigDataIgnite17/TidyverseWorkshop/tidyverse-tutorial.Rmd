### A little help from my friends

This tutorial has evolved from presentations and tutorials made by

 * Randall Pruim
 * Danny Kaplan
 * Jo Hardin
 * Miles Ott
 * Nicholas Horton

## Data used in the tutorial

For simplicity, all the data in this tutorial come from R packages.
We will rename some data sets so that in this tutorial data sets 
are capitalized and variables are not.

```{r}
require(mosaic)        # loads part of tidyverse and some data sets
require(ggplot2movies) # contains a movies dataset
require(babynames)     # number of kids with each name for over 100 yrs
require(nycflights13)  # all flights in/out of NYC in 2013

# rename so data sets are capitalized
Movies    <- movies
Babynames <- babynames
Flights   <- flights
Planes    <- planes
Airports  <- airports
```

## What is the tidyverse?

### A collection of R packages 

 * written by Hadley Wickham (and friends)
 
 * that **play well together** 

 * to **create and manage**  
 
 * **tidy data**.

<div align="center">
### data I have \ $\stackrel{\mbox{tidyverse}}{\longrightarrow}$  \ data I want
</div>

## Tidy data

  * Rows are cases (of interest)
  
  * Columns are variables

### Tidy vs Clean

As grandma says: tidy and clean are two different things

  * tidy data may not be clean, but
  * tidy data are easier to clean,
  * and it is easier to tell whether data are clean when they are tidy 
  

## Chaining with %>%

### The following are almost equivalent

```{r eval = FALSE}
f(x, y, ...)
```

```{r eval = FALSE}
x %>% f(y, ...)
```

(When and where `x` is evaluated is not exactly the same and can matter.)

### Exercise

Add a second line that is equivalent to the first but uses `%>%`.
(Note: Unless you use `set.seed()` you will get different results each time
because of different random choices.)

```{r, pipe01, exercise = TRUE}
sample_n(Movies, 3)     # 3 random movies
```

## Little Bunny Foo Foo

Here's a silly example that illustrates why `%>%` is helpful.

    Little bunny Foo Foo
    Went hopping through the forest
    Scooping up the field mice
    And bopping them on the head.

### Without chaining

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bop(scoop(hop(foo_foo, through = forest), up = field_mice), on = head)
```

### With chaining

```{r, eval = FALSE}
foo_foo %>%
  hop(through = forest) %>%
  scoop(up = field_mice) %>%
  bop(on = head)
```

### Advantages of Chaining

  * reduces parenthesis chasing
  * keeps arguments near functions
  * mirrors order of operations (making code easier to read)
  * facilitates code editing (easy to eliminate or insert a step)

## Data Verbs

### Chaining in the tidyverse

Many functions in `tidyverse` 

  * take tidy data as a first argument
  
  * return tidy data as a result
  
This sets them up for chaining:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
new_data <-
  old_data %>%
  do_this( ... ) %>%
  and_that( ... ) %>%
  and_the_other( ... )
```

We will refer to these kinds of functions as (transitive) **data verbs** 
because they do something to (tidy) data *without side effects*.

## Movies Data

The `Movies` data set contains information about movies.

```{r, inspect, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>% glimpse()
```

### Exercises

 1. Change `glimpse()` to `inspect()` in the previous box; `inspect()` provides
an alternative way to take a quick look at a data set.

 2. Now change to `nrow()`.  What does this function do?
 
 3. Now change to `names()`.  What does this function do?
 
 4. Want more information?  Try `?movies`. (Note lower case here.)

### Quiz

```{r, quiz, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("Is inspect() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  ),
  question("Is glimpse() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data."),
    answer("No, it has side effects.", correct = TRUE)
  ),
  question("Is nrow() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  ),
  question("Is names() a data verb?",
    answer("Yes."),
    answer("No, its first argument is not tidy data."),
    answer("No, it doesn't return tidy data.", correct = TRUE),
    answer("No, it has side effects.")
  )
)
```

## 6 Main Data Verbs

We'll go through each of these in more detail in just a moment,
but here are the key data verbs.

### Reduction

1. `summarise()`: compute summary statistics

  * result is a 1-row data frame.  (This is a white lie, but useful for now.)

### Rows 

2. `filter()`:  **keep rows** that match logical condition (discard the others)
3. `arrange()`: reorder the rows (i.e., sort)

### Columns

4. `select()`: **discard** some **variables** (columns)
5. `mutate()`: create **new variables** and add them to the data

### Grouping

6. `group_by()`: data unchanged, but groups are noted.

### But wait, there's more!  

Here are some other data verbs


- `transmute()` like `mutate()`, but returns only the new variables
- `rename()`: rename some of the variables
- `distinct()`: returns each unique row once
- `sample_n()`: returns randomly selected row(s)
- `sample_frac()`: returns randomly selected row(s)
- `head()`:  returns the first few rows
- `tail()`: returns the last few rows
- `ungroup()`:  clear grouping notes

## One-row summaries with summarise()

Note: `summarize()` works for non New Zelanders, 
but it conflicts with a funciton with that same name in another package.

```{r, summarise, exercise = TRUE}
# number of movies (cases) in movie data
Movies %>% summarise(n())
```

### Multi-tasking allowed

```{r, summarise-2, exercise = TRUE}
# mean and total number of minutes of all the movies
Movies %>% 
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_length  = mean(length, na.rm = TRUE), 
    total_length =  sum(length, na.rm = TRUE)
    )
```

### Useful functions for use with summarise()

- `min()`, `max()`, `mean()`, `sum()`, `sd()`, `median()`, `IQR()`, ...
- `n()`: number of observations in the current group
- `n_distinct()`: number of unique values of a variable
- `first_value()`, `last_value()`, `nth_value(x, n)`


## select()

Let's make a data set that has fewer variables.

```{r, slim-movies, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies <- 
  Movies %>% select(title, budget, length, mpaa)

Slim_Movies %>% inspect()
```

- Reminder: `select()` is for *columns*

## Creating subsets -- filter() and friends

Often it is useful to work with a subset of the data 

 * inspect a few rows to understand the data
 * small data sets for prototyping analysis methods
 * analyses applied only to an "interesting" subset of the data
 * training and test data sets

### Beginning and End

```{r, head-tail, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% head(3)       # first few rows
Slim_Movies %>% tail(3)       # last few rows
```

### Random sample

```{r, random, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% sample_n(3)          # 3 random rows
Slim_Movies %>% sample_frac(.00007)  # random fraction of rows
```

### filter()

Let's use only use movies (cases) that have budget information and 
have shorter titles.

```{r, filter-budget, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 <- 
  Movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(budget), nchar(title) <= 24)

Movies2 %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), longest = max(nchar(title)))
```

## Creating new variables -- mutate() and friends

#### Exercise

Change `mutate()` to `transmute()`.  How do they differ?

```{r, mutate, exercise = TRUE}
Slim_Movies %>% 
  filter(!is.na(budget)) %>%
  mutate(dpm = round(budget / length, 2)) %>%   # $ per minute
  head(6)
```


## group_by()

`group_by()` is what makes this system really hum.  When tidy data is marked
with groups, some subsequent data verbs are applied **within groups**.


```{r, group-by, exercise = TRUE}
# mean length of movies in hours for all the movies, broken down by mpaa
Movies2 %>% 
  mutate(
    hours = length / 60,
    dpm = budget / length) %>% 
  group_by(mpaa) %>% 
  summarise(n = n(), mean_length = mean(hours, na.rm = TRUE))
```

#### Exercise

 1. Add some additional summaries of your choosing.
 2. Group by length of title instead of by rating.

### Important Note

Groups are in some sense "invisible", and it is easy to forget about them.
When saving data that have been created with a grouping, you may want to 
use `ungroup()` to remove the grouping information and let future you
start fresh -- just saying...

### group() and mutate()

`group()` impacts (some) other operations as well.  What happens when 
`mutate()` is applied after `group()`?

```{r, group-mutate, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>%
  group_by(mpaa) %>%
  mutate(length_rank = rank(-length)) %>%
  filter(length_rank < 3) %>%
  select(title, length, length_rank)
```

### Important Note

Groups are in some sense "invisible", and it is easy to forget about them.
When saving data that have been created with a grouping, you may want to 
use `ungroup()` to remove the grouping information and let future you
start fresh -- just saying...


## arrange() reorders the cases

#### Exercise


```{r, arange-issues, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>%
  group_by(mpaa) %>%
  mutate(length_rank = rank(-length)) %>%
  filter(length_rank <= 3) %>%
  select(title, length, length_rank)  %>%
  arrange(mpaa, length_rank)
```

#### Note about groups

By default, `arrange()` ignores groups.  If you use `.by_group = TRUE`,
then sorting will be done by grouping variables first, then by additional
variables specified.

### Group, summarise, arrange

Group-summarise-arrange is a common operation to list groups in
an order based on some calculation.  

#### Exercise

Fill in the missing pieces here to list the ratings in order
of average length of film.  Feel free to include additional
summar quantities as well if you like.

```{r, arrange, exercise = TRUE}
Movies2 %>% 
  group_by( ?? )  %>% 
  summarise( ?? ) %>%
  arrange( ?? )
```


## What else is there?

### Lots more.  Here are few examples.

 * `spread()` and `gather()` for converting from "long" to "wide or 
 from "wide" to "long" shapes
 
 * `separate()` splitting a single variable into multiple variables.

 * `bind_rows()` and `bind_cols()` to (intelligently) glue data frames top-to-bottom or left-to-right.
 
 * `left_join()`, `right_join()`, `inner_join()`, etc. for merging data 
 from multiple sources.  (Like joins in SQL.)
 
 * `lubridate` has functions for working with dates and times
 
[TB Case Study tutorial](http://rsconnect.calvin.edu/tidy-tb) illustrates
some of these.

### Database connections

These same commands can be used to [manage data in an SQL data base](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/).
 
* converts data verbs into SQL query
* allows you to inspect the query
* only fetches a few rows unless you ask for more (to save time while
  you are debugging)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# establish connection -- details vary by type of database
con <- DBI::dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 
  host = "database.rstudio.com",
  user = "hadley",
  password = rstudioapi::askForPassword("Database password")
)

# extract a table
flights_db <- tbl(con, "flights")

# treat it just like in-memory data (mostly)
flights_db %>%
  group_by(...) %>%
  mutate(...) %>%
  summarise(...) %>%
  collect()          # get me all of the data
```

**Note:** Some R commands can't be translated into SQL and so don't work inside
`mutate()`, `summarise()`, etc. 

## Your Turn -- More Movies

### A Smaller Data Set

When starting, it can be helpful to work with a small subset of the data.  When
you have your data wrangling statements in working order, shift to the entire
data table.

```{r, small-subset, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies <-
  Movies %>%
  filter(year > 2000) %>%
  filter(mpaa != "") 
```

You can use the smaller data set as you are figuring out the solutions to these
exercises.  Once have it sussed, you can switch to the full `Movies` data.

### Exercises

#### What is the average IMDB user rating?

```{r, rating, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  summarise(avg = ????(rating)) 
```


#### What is the average IMDB user rating of movies for each mpaa category?

```{r, rating-by-cat, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>% 
  group_by(????) %>% 
  summarise(avg = ????(rating))
```

#### How many Action Movies in each year?

```{r, action-movies, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  group_by(????) %>%
  summarise(Actioncount = sum(????))
```

#### How many Comedies of each mpaa rating in each year?

```{r, comedies, exercise = TRUE}
RecentMovies %>%
  group_by(????, ????) %>%
  summarise(????)
```


#### Track the average IMDB ratings for movies with mpaa "R" over the years.

```{r r-movies, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>%
  filter(mpaa == "R") %>%     # just the rated R movies
  group_by(year) %>%          # for each year for each movie title
  summarise(mean_user_rating = ????) %>%
  gf_point(mean_user_rating ~ year)  # plot results
```


#### Track the number of IMDB ratings given to R movies over the years

You could use total number or average number.  Your choice.

(Hint: Use `votes` to see how many votes were cast for each movie.)

```{r r-movies-2, exercise = TRUE}
Movies %>%
  filter(mpaa == "R") %>%     # just the rated R movies
  group_by(year) %>%          # for each year for each movie title
  summarise(????) %>%
  gf_line(??? ~ year)  # plot results
```

#### Challenge

Calculate the average per rating rather than the average per movie.
