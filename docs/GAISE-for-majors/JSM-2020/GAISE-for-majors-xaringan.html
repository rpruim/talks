## GAISE for Majors

### Overview and Sampler

---

## Some Background

#### Calvin University 

* Liberal arts university with ~3500 undergraduate students
* Large core curriculum, small majors (Statistics = ~ 36 + 10 hours)


&lt;img src="images/Calvin-overhead-chapel.jpg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Some Background

#### Prob/Stats sequence at Calvin

* Taken by students from many programs

* Some of these students have not had statistics before

* The first time I taught our prob/stat sequence (in 2005)

    * Just under half of students took the second course
    
    * Most were more interested in statistics than in probability
    
    * But the course I inherited was basically all probability in the first semester
    
--

    * GAISE was brand new and change was afoot in Intro Stats
    (Cobb's *Ptolameic Curriculum*, etc.)

2. Focus on **conceptual understanding**.
    
3. Integrate **real data** with a **context** and **purpose**.
    
4. Foster **active learning**.
    
5. Use **technology** to explore concepts and analyze data.
    
6. Use **assessments** to improve and evaluate student learning.

### Question: Why should Intro Stats get all the good stuff?



---

class: big-strong

## GAISE College -- 6 Recommendations

1. Teach statistical thinking (investigative, multivariable)
    
2. Focus on **conceptual understanding**.
    * &lt;span class="jsm"&gt;Michael Lavine&lt;/span&gt; (10:45): 
    "Likelihood ... is the main *statistical concept* we should teach"

3. Integrate real data with a context and purpose.

4. Foster **active learning**.
    * &lt;span class="jsm"&gt;Erin E Blankenship&lt;/span&gt; (11:25): *Active Learning, Not Just for Intro Stats*
    
5. Use technology to explore concepts and analyze data.

6. Use **assessments** to improve and evaluate student learning. 
    * &lt;span class="jsm"&gt;Jennifer Green&lt;/span&gt; (11:05): *Learning Through Assessment*

## GAISE College -- Goals 1 - 4 (of 9)

These goals "summarize what a student should know and understand at the
conclusion of a **first course** in statistics. Achieving this knowledge will
require learning some statistical techniques, but mastering specific techniques
is not as important as understanding the statistical concepts and principles
that underlie such techniques."

**1.** Students should become **critical consumers** of statistically-based results reported in
popular media, recognizing whether reported results reasonably follow from the study
and analysis conducted.

**2.** Students should be able to **recognize** questions for which the investigative process in
**statistics would be useful** and should be able to answer questions using the investigative
process.

**3.** Students should be able to **produce graphical displays and numerical summaries** and
interpret what graphs do and do not reveal.

**4.** Students should recognize and be able to explain the **central role of variability** in the field
of statistics.

---

class: big-strong

## GAISE College -- Goals 5 - 9

**5.** Students should recognize and be able to explain the 
**central role of randomness** in designing studies and drawing conclusions.

* &lt;span class = "jsm"&gt;Dennis Sun&lt;/span&gt; (10:25): "interleave probability and statistical inference topics"

**6.** Students should gain experience with how **statistical models**, including multivariable
models, are used.

* &lt;span class = "jsm"&gt;Michael Lavine&lt;/span&gt; (10:45): "Likelihood is the primary way to quantify the quality of a probability model."  

**7.** Students should demonstrate an understanding of, and ability to use, basic ideas of
**statistical inference**, both hypothesis tests and interval estimation, in a variety of settings.

**8.** Students should be able to interpret and draw conclusions from 
**standard output from statistical software packages**.

**9.** Students should demonstrate an awareness of **ethical issues** associated with sound
statistical practice.

&lt;img src="images/pour-milk-tea.jpg" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

* Any situation where a null hypothesis that a proportion is 50% will do.  (But don't use
those words.)

```r
*rflip()           # chatty version of rbinom() from mosaic package

~~Probability then Statistics~~ `\(\rightarrow\)` **Probability FOR Statistics**
&lt;/span&gt;


Use statistical ideas to motivate learning probability.

* See basics of inference in first semester (tests, intervals, power, simulation-based methods)

* Use technology to emphasize big ideas.

Many more examples

--

* Golfballs in the Yard `\(\to\)` Test Stats &amp; Null Distributions (Thanks: A Rossman)

--

* How many replicates do I need to estimate a p-value empirically?

--

* Robustness: Is the coverage rate in my simulation consistent with 
nominal value?

--

* If two iid samples of size `\(n\)` are drawn the same normal distribution, what is the 
probability that the mean of the second sample will lie in the 95% CI produced by the first
sample?

&lt;span class="jsm"&gt;Dennis Sun&lt;/span&gt; has an even better name for this:

* &lt;span class="jsm"&gt;*Dual Immersion in Probability and Statistics*&lt;/span&gt; (next presentation) 

---

## Technology

These days the use of technology in a statistics class is not so controversial.  

&lt;img src="images/madge.jpg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--


* Allows us to use **larger, more interesting data** sets

* Allows us to **focus attention** on the right parts of the task

* Allows us to teach **reproducible** analysis methods (eg, RMarkdown, scripting)

---

## Technology

R/RStudio is a popular choice (and is what I use)

* Free

* Toolkit get better rapidly (RStudio, tidyverse, publishing tools, etc.)

* Prepares students for future careers

&gt; Hi Professor Pruim, 

&gt; I took your Stats 343 class a few years ago and was first introduced to R at that time. I now use R every day for work and am so appreciative of the head start that I got in your class.

## Technology: You Gotta Have Style

But just using a statistical package like R/RStudio is not enough -- it needs to
be **used well**.

--

* Teach R as a language, but not a "programming" language

    * Much can be done with **simple declarative commands**, perhaps chained with `%&gt;%`.
    * Focus on **communicating to R** what you want to happen (what do you want R to do?
    what must it know to do that?)
    * Learning to write **simple functions** is a big power boost (and not that hard).

* **Be professional** about how you use technology

    * Adopt a set of **complementary tools** and a **consistent style**
        * Equivalent to using correct terminology and good notation
        
    * Instructors should know more than they teach

## Stat 344: First Exam Problem

**Problem 1** `&lt;Details omitted&gt;`

&lt;ol type = 'a'&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What is the maximum likelihood estimate for `\(\theta\)`?
&lt;li&gt; If we test the null hypothesis that `\(\theta = 2.5\)`, what is the p-value?
&lt;li&gt; What is the 95% likelihood confidence interval for `\(\theta\)`?
&lt;/ol&gt;

--

Could start several ways

* Provide (log) likelihood function.
* Provide data and model.
* Could require numerical or analytical approaches.

--

But some of my students were getting lost in the details (logs, derivatives, numerical optimizers, etc.), so ...

## Stat 344: First Exam Problem -- With Preamble

Below is a graph of a log likelihood function `\(l(\theta)\)` for a data set with
`\(n = 23\)`.

&lt;img src="GAISE-for-majors-xaringan_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Using the information provided, answer the following questions as accurately as you can.

&lt;!-- Your work should make it clear how you are getting your answers and that you know how to get more precise values --&gt;
&lt;!-- if you had access to the log-likelihood function and not just the graph of it. --&gt;

&lt;ol type = 'a'&gt;
&lt;li&gt; What is the maximum likelihood estimate for `\(\theta\)`?
&lt;li&gt; If we test the null hypothesis that `\(\theta = 2.5\)`, what is the p-value?
&lt;li&gt; What is the 95% likelihood confidence interval for `\(\theta\)`?
&lt;/ol&gt;


---

## Visualizing Likelihood

`maxLik` + `fastR2` make it easy to visualize likelihood (for one parameter).







```r
ml &lt;- maxLik2(loglikelihood, start = c(theta = 2), x = data)
plot(ml, ci = c("lik", "wald"))
```

```

## Poisson and Exponential

Take advantage of the connection between the two distributions to help students shake 
a common misunderstanding of the Poisson rate parameter `\(\lambda\)`.

* Students tend to think about rate as in **metronome**, instead of like this...

## Encourage Students to Work Together


&lt;img src="images/reading-room.jpg" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Summary

* Take all those good ideas from Intro Stats and **adapt** them for (Probability &amp;) Math Stats.

    * (Hint: Sometimes adapt = use without modification.)

* If possible think of **probability and statistics** as two parts of a larger whole.

* Use **technology** to support exploration, confirmation, and conceptual understanding.

    * Choose a toolkit with high bang/buck:  "Less volume, more creativity"
    
    * Adopt strong coding conventions and ~~encourage~~ force your students to do so, too.
    
    * Keep looking for new things -- or write them!

* Design activities creatively to **teach, reinforce, and assess**.

    * Be on a perpetual scavenger hunt for ideas, data sets, ...
