## Abstract

Randomness is difficult to think about.  And not just for students struggling to learn
probability rules or to correctly interpret p-values and confidence intervals,
or for the general public trying to interpret the results of COVID tests, models
of transmission, or measures of vaccine efficacy and effectiveness.
Randomness has also presented challenges to philosophers and theologians.
Just what is randomness? And what does God have to do with it?
In this talk, I'll present some musings about randomness and God's governance.


Whether and how God uses randomness is difficult to tell, but randomness may not
be as incompatible with a creating and sustaining God as some Christians fear.
