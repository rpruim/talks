# Random Thoughts

### A few caveats before we begin ...

--

1. This is mostly a personal reflection.

--

2. Randomness is ~~Difficult~~ Challenging.

  a. technical challenges
  
  b. vocabulary challenges
  
  c. disciplinary challenges
--

3. Frustrating lack of methodology (for the questions I'm approaching).

  a. no theorems
  
  b. no data analysis
  
  c. no algorithms
  
  d. not clear other disciplines have what it takes either

# What is Randomness?

1. **Unpredictability** [Process Randomness]

--

  * A coin toss

--

2. **Unknowability** [Epistemological Randomness]

--

  * A different coin toss

--

3. **Incompressibility** [Descriptive Randomness]

--

    * The record of a a sequence of coin tosses:  

    ```
        TTHHTTHHTTHHHHHHHHTTTTTTTTHHTTHHHHTTHHHH
    ```

1. I have always liked playing games -- and it seems to be hereditary.

2. In our family, you play to win (but lose gracefully).

--

3. Randomness can balance the game.

# War and Candy Land

A completely random game is just a **slow way to flip a coin** 

* Not very interesting to play unless you just like to see how the randomness plays out (slowly).

At each step:

* Pick a random corner of the triangle.
* Move half-way to that corner and place a dot.

# Some Big Questoins

1. Does God use randomness to achieve his purposes?

--

2. If so, does that change how we think about God (and ourselves)?

3. If not, why do random models do such a good job of explaining things?


---

# Does it Matter?

Does it matter how God relates to (apparent) randomness?

--

1. If things are not random, why do they behave that way?

    * Mediation of Christ: to make the world more liveable for humans?
    * Why doesn't God make different choices?
    
--

2. Life events

    * Lots
    * Coincidenes
    * Insurance

# A Thought Experiment

---

# Parting (random) thoughts

1. Most scientists using randomness in their models are doing because 
**random models work**, not because they have a particular 
philosophic/theological position.

--

2. **Randomness** can be used **creatively** to acheive desired ends.

    * Game design [Sorry, cribbage, etc.]
    * Quantum computation
    * Genetics?

--

3. Allowing **a role for randomness does not preclude a role for God**.

    * Personifying change doesn't bring clarity to the discussion.
    * Not God or chance, rather God via chance?

--

4. I prefer **symmetric interpretations** of randomness.

    * "God when it's good, random when it's bad" seems contrived.
    * It is easy to selectively choose our interpretation based on the situation.
