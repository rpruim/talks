Goals
=====

What I will try to do

 * give a tour of `ggplot2`
 
 * introduce tools from `dplyr` and `tidyr` that help prepare data for plotting
 
 * explain how to think about plots the `ggplot2` way
 
 * prepare/encourage you to learn more later
 
What I can't do in one session

 * show every bell and whistle
 
 * make you an expert at using `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, and `tidyr`


Set up
======

```{r}
require(mosaic)    # loads ggplot2 as well
theme_set(theme_minimal())
data(Births78)     # restore fresh version of Births78
head(Births78, 3)
```


The grammar of graphics
=======================

**geom**: the geometric "shape" used to display data (glyph)
 
 * bar, point, line, ribbon, text, etc.
 
**aesthetic**: an attribute controlling how geom is displayed

 * x position, y position, color, fill, shape, size, etc.

**scale**: conversion of raw data to visual display

 * particular assignment of colors, shapes, sizes, etc. 
 
**guide**: helps user convert visual data back into raw data (legends, axes)

**stat**: a transformation applied to data before geom gets it

 * example: histograms work on binned data
 
How do we make this plot?
=========================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_point()
```

\pause

Two Questions:

\pause

 1. What do we want R to do?  (What is the goal?)
 
 
 2. What does R need to know?

How do we make this plot?
=========================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(
  data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Two Questions:

 1. Goal: scatterplot = a plot with points
 
 2. What does R need to know?
 
    * data source: `Births78`

    * aesthetics: 
 
        * `date -> x`
        * `births -> y`
        * default color (same for all points) 


How do we make this plot?
=========================

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_point()
```

 1. Goal: scatterplot = a plot with points
 
    * `ggplot() + geom_point()`
 
 2. What does R need to know?
 
    * data source: `data = Births78`

    * aesthetics: `aes(x = date, y = births)`

\pause

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot(data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_point()
```

\pause

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.height = 1.5}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births))  
```

How do we make this plot?
====================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Births78) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) 
```

What has changed?  \pause

 * new aesthetic: mapping color to day of week


Mapping color to day of week
====================


```{r, fig.height = 2.0}
ggplot(data = Births78) +
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday))
```

How do we make this plot?
====================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Births78) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) 
```

\pause

This time we use lines instead of dots

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Births78) +
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) 
```

How do we make this plot?
====================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

\pause

This time we have two **layers**, one with points and one with
lines

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(data = Births78, 
       aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) + 
  geom_point() +  geom_line()
```
\pause

 *  The layers are placed one on top of the other:  the points 
are *below* and the lines are *above*.   

 * `data` and `aes` specified in `ggplot()` affect all geoms
 
Alternative Syntax
===================

```{r}
Births78 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births, color = wday)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_line()
```

What does this do?
=============

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point()  
```

\pause

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Births78 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births, color = "navy")) + 
  geom_point()  
```

This is *mapping* the color aesthetic to a new variable with 
only one value ("navy").  
So all the dots get set to the same color, but it's not navy.

Setting vs. Mapping
============

If we want to *set* the color to be navy for all of the dots, we do 
it this way:

```{r}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births)) +   # map these 
  geom_point(color = "navy")        # set this
```

* Note that `color = "navy"` is now outside of the aesthetics list.  That's how `ggplot2` distinguishes between mapping and setting.

How do we make this plot?
===========================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = wday)) +        # map color here
  geom_point(color = "navy")            # set color here
```
\pause

```{r, eval = FALSE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births)) + 
  geom_line(aes(color = wday)) +       # map color here
  geom_point(color = "navy")           # set color here
```

* `ggplot()` establishes the default data and aesthetics
for the geoms, but each geom may change these defaults.

* good practice: put into `ggplot()` the things that affect all (or most) of the layers; rest in `geom_blah()`

Other geoms
===========
```{r, echo = TRUE, comment = NA}
apropos("^geom_") %>% head(21)
```

help pages will tell you their aesthetics, default stats, etc.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?geom_area             # for example
```


Let's try geom_area
===============
```{r, eval = TRUE}
Births78 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = births, fill = wday)) + 
  geom_area()
```

This is not a good plot
\pause

* overplotting is hiding much of the data
* extending y-axis to 0 may or may not be desirable.

Side note: what makes a plot good?
================

Most (all?) graphics are intended to help us make comparisons

* How does something change over time?
* Do my treatments matter?  How much?
* Do men and women respond the same way?

**Key plot metric:** Does my plot make the comparisions 
I am interested in 

* easily, and 
* accurately?

Time for some different data
============================

HELPrct: Health Evaluation and Linkage to Primary care randomized
clinical trial
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?HELPrct
```

Subjects admitted for treatment for addiction to one 
of three substances.

Why are these people in the study?
==================================

```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = substance)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

\pause

* Hmm.  What's up with `y`?
\pause

    * `stat_bin()` is being applied to the data before the 
    `geom_bar()` gets to do its thing.  Binning creates the
    `y` values.

Data Flow
=========

\[
\mbox{org data}
\stackrel{\mbox{\ stat\ }}{\longrightarrow}
\mbox{statified}
\stackrel{\mbox{aesthetics}}{\longrightarrow}
\mbox{aesthetic data}
\stackrel{\mbox{\ scales\ }}{\longrightarrow}
\mbox{scaled data}
\]

Simplifications:

 * Aesthetics get computed twice, once before the stat and again after.   Examples: bar charts, histograms
 
* We need to look at the aesthetics to figure out which variable 
   to bin 
   
    * then the stat does the binning
    * bin counts become part of the aesthetics for geom: `y = ..count..`
    
* This process happens *in each layer*

* `stat_identity()` is the "do nothing" stat.


How old are people in the HELP study?
===============================

\pause
```{r, fig.height = 1.5, message = TRUE}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram()
```

Notice the messages

* `stat_bin`:  Histograms are not mapping the raw data but
binned data.  
`stat_bin()` performs the data transformation.

* `binwidth`: a default binwidth has been selected, but we should
really choose our own.

Setting the binwidth manually
=============================

```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2)
```


How old are people in the HELP study? -- Other geoms
===============================
```{r, fig.height = 2.3, size = "small"}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_ash(binwidth = 2, colour = "navy", size = 1.2) +
  geom_density(colour = "forestgreen", size = 1.2) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 2, aes(y = ..density..)) 
```



Selecting stat and geom manually
================================
Every geom comes with a default stat

* for simple cases, the stat is `stat_identity()` which does nothing
* we can mix and match geoms and stats however we like

```{r, fig.height = 2.0}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density")
```

Selecting stat and geom manually
================================
Every stat comes with a default geom, every geom with a default stat

* we can specify stat instead of geom, if we prefer
* we can mix and match geoms and stats however we like

```{r, fig.height = 2.0}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  stat_density(geom = "line")
```

More combinations
=====================

```{r, fig.height = 1.7}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_point(stat = "bin", binwidth = 3) + 
  geom_line(stat = "bin", binwidth = 3)  
```

```{r, fig.height = 1.7}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_area(stat = "bin", binwidth = 3)  
```

```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age)) + 
  geom_point(stat = "bin", binwidth = 3, aes(size = ..count..)) +
  geom_line(stat = "bin", binwidth = 3) 
```

Your turn:  How much do they drink? (i1)
===================

Create a plot that shows the distribution of the average daily
alcohol consumption in the past 30 days (`i1`).

How much do they drink? (i1)
===================

```{r, fig.height = 1.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = i1)) + geom_histogram()
```
```{r, fig.height = 1.5}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = i1)) + geom_area(stat = "density")
```

Covariates: Adding in more variables
========================

Q. How does alcohol consumption (or age, your choice)
differ by sex and substance (alcohol, cocaine, heroin)?

Decisions:

* How will we display the variables: 
`i1` (or `age`), `sex`, `substance`

* What comparisons are we most interested in?

Give it a try.

* Note: I'm cheating a bit.  You may want to do some things
I haven't shown you yet.  (Feel free to ask.)

Covariates: Adding in more variables
========================

Using color and linetype:

```{r, fig.height = 1.3}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = i1, color = substance, linetype = sex)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density")
```

Using color and facets

```{r, fig.height = 1.3}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = i1, color = substance)) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density") + facet_grid( . ~ sex)
```

Boxplots 
========================
Boxplots use `stat_quantile()` 
which computes a five-number summary 
(roughly the five quartiles of the data) and uses them to define a 
"box" and "whiskers".
The quantitative variable must be `y`, and there must be an 
additional `x` variable. 

```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = substance, y = age, color = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

Horizontal boxplots
===================
Horizontal boxplots 
are obtained by flipping the coordinate system:
```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = substance, y = age, color = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  coord_flip()
```

* `coord_flip()` may be used with other plots as well to reverse the roles
of `x` and `y` on the plot.

Give me some space
==================
We've triggered a new feature: `dodge` (for dodging things left/right).
We can control how much if we set the dodge manually.

```{r}
HELPrct %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = substance, y = age, color = sex)) + 
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 1)) 
```


Issues with bigger data
=========

```{r}
require(NHANES); dim(NHANES)
NHANES %>%  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_point() + facet_grid(Gender ~ PregnantNow)
```

* Although we can see a generally positive association (as we would 
expect), the overplotting may be hiding information.

Using alpha (opacity)
=========

One way to deal with overplotting is to set the opacity low.

```{r}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.01) + 
  facet_grid(Gender ~ PregnantNow)
```

geom_density2d
==============
Alternatively (or simultaneously) we might prefere a different 
geom altogether.

```{r}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_density2d() + facet_grid(Gender ~ PregnantNow)
```


geom_hex
==============
```{r}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_hex() + facet_grid(Gender ~ PregnantNow)
```

Multiple layers
===============

```{r}
ggplot(data = HELPrct, aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) +
  geom_jitter(alpha = .6) +
  coord_flip()
```

Multiple layers
===============

```{r, size = "small"}
ggplot(data = HELPrct, aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.size = 0) +
  geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = .3, height = 0)) +
  coord_flip()
```

Labeling
========

```{r}
NHANES %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Height, y = Weight)) +
  geom_hex() + facet_grid(Gender ~ PregnantNow) +
  labs(x = "waist (m)", y = "weight (kg)", 
       title = "weight vs height")
```

Things I haven't mentioned (much)
=================================

 * scales (fine tuning mapping from data to plot)
 
 * guides (so reader can map from plot to data)
 
 * coords (`coord_flip()` is good to know about)
 
 * themes (for customizing appearance)

```{r, fig.width = 14}
require(ggthemes)
ggplot(data = Births78, aes(x = date, y = births)) +
       geom_point() + theme_wsj() # wall street journal
```

 `position_stack()`, etc.)

A little bit of everything
=======
```{r, fig.width = 14, tidy = FALSE}
ggplot(data = HELPrct, 
       aes(x = substance, y = age, color = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot(position = position_dodge(width = 1)) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = sex), alpha = .5, 
    position = position_jitterdodge(dodge.width = 1)) + 
  facet_wrap(~homeless)
```

A short cut
================


`mplot(dataframe)` provides an interactive plotting tool 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mplot(HELPrct)
```

* quickly make several plots from a data frame
* can show the expression so you can learn how to do it or 
copy and paste into another document
* `ggplot2` or `lattice`

What's around the corner?
=========================

`ggvis` 

 * dynamic graphics (brushing, sliders, tooltips, etc.)
 
   * uses Vega (D3) to animate plots in a browser
 
 * similar structure to `ggplot2` but different syntax and names
 

 
Dynamic documents

 * combination of `RMarkdown`, `ggvis`, and `shiny`
